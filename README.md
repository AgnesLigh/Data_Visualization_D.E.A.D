# Data_Visualization_D.E.A.D

This repo contains implemented visuals for the DEAD dataset. This dataset is from the DEAD company which is an adventuring equipment sales company that delivers products to the realms of Faerun and beyond. The data includes information regarding orders of products, the customers associated with those orders, and the accountants that work for the DEAD company that manage each customer account.

There are two implemented visuals
1. The geography of Faerun and the distribution of orders across the realm.

This visual allows the user to observe:
* Order count
* â€¦
* Delivery times

Also when a nation is selected, the user can visualize the underlying information regarding the account managers, cities within that nation, and the amount of products subtypes ordered within that nation. 

2. The seasonality of the orders received and delivered by the DEAD company. 

There are two histograms featured in this visual:
* (upper) broad overview of order information
* (lower) granular overview of order information by filtering order information by product subtype

The user can select the desired date ranges to visualize.
